# NDEx Jupyter Notebooks Tutorials
This repository contains tutorials and code examples to work with networks using the ndex2 Python Client and NiceCX object class. These tutorials requires Python 3.6+ and the ndex2 module. See the [ndex2 client](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex2-client#readme) for installation instructions.

## [Protocol 4: Working with NDEx Networks in Python](https://github.com/rpillich/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Working%20with%20NDEx%20Networks%20in%20Python.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to perform some simple operations on networks stored in NDEx, using the ndex2 client and NiceCX class. This notebook is part of the latest NDEx publication in the journal Current Protocols in Bioinformatics (reference coming soon).

## [ndex2 Client Tutorial](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NDEx2%20Client%20v2.0%20Tutorial.ipynb)
In this tutorial you will learn to use the ndex2 Python client. The ndex2 client is a module that simplifies access to the NDEx Server API and provides convenience methods for common operations on networks. [**>> Go to Tutorial**](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NDEx2%20Client%20v2.0%20Tutorial.ipynb)

## [ndex2 Client Tutorial: Querying networks](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NDEx%20Query%20Tutorial.ipynb)
This tutorial shows how to query networks in NDEx, extract a subset of the data  and display the results using both the ndex2 client and NiceCX object class. [**>> Go to Tutorial**](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NDEx%20Query%20Tutorial.ipynb)

## [NiceCX Tutorial](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NiceCX%20v2.0%20Tutorial.ipynb)
In this tutorial you will learn to use NiceCX, a simple data model that is part of the ndex2 client module. NiceCX facilitates creating and working with networks, including interfaces to NetworkX and Pandas. [**>> Go to Tutorial**](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NiceCX%20v2.0%20Tutorial.ipynb)

## [NiceCX Tutorial: Navigating the Network](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NiceCX%20v2.0%20navigating%20the%20network.ipynb)
This tutorial is focused on accessing a network's nodes, edges and attributes. [**>> Go to Tutorial**](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NiceCX%20v2.0%20navigating%20the%20network.ipynb)

## [NiceCX Tutorial: Prune Zero Degree Nodes](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/NiceCX%20v2.0%20prune%20zero%20degree%20nodes.ipynb)
In this tutorial you will learn how to manipulate an NDEx network by converting it to a networkx graph() object. This tutorial requires **_Python 3.7 and networkx 2.4_**.
